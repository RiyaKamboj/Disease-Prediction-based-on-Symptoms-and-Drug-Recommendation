# Disease-Prediction-based-on-Symptoms-and-Drug-Recommendation
This repository contains machine learning models for disease prediction and drug recommendation. The models are trained on medical datasets and aim to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases and recommending appropriate medications.
## Introduction
In today's healthcare industry, the ability to accurately predict diseases and recommend suitable medications is crucial for effective patient care. Machine learning models offer a promising approach to automate and enhance this process by analyzing patient symptoms and historical data to make predictions.
## Features
-*Disease Prediction: Various machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree, are employed to predict diseases based on patient symptoms.
-*Drug Recommendation: Machine learning models recommend medications based on patient diagnosis and medical history.
-Dataset: The models are trained on comprehensive medical datasets containing information about patient symptoms, diseases, and medications.
## Usage
-Run the disease_prediction.ipynb notebook or disease_prediction.py script to train and evaluate disease prediction models.
-Run the drug_recommendation.ipynb notebook or drug_recommendation.py script to train and evaluate drug recommendation models.
-Modify the input data and parameters as needed to customize the predictions for your specific use case.
